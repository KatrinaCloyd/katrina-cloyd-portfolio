                <p>In high school I thought I would grow up to be an art teacher or a poet, or ideally both.</p>
                <p>In college, for a short while, I thought I would be an artist, but I went back to the art teacher plan. After college, with my Ohio teaching license in hand, I thought I would never be an art teacherâ€¦</p>
                <p>Then I became an Oregonian. I began painting, baking, jewelry making, street fair vending, gardening, freelancing, and pretty much trying it all. I needed a creative outlet and an array of avenues led me to design.</p>
                <p>So I became a Graphic Designer. Years of that corporate life taught me so much but I still wanted more. I wanted a challenge, more variance in the day to day... <br />I wanted to know how to build my own site!</p>
                <p>So I became a Software Engineer.<br />And I finally feel like I have found my place. Now I get to problem solve with new challenges every day. I get to be creative in my solutions and thinking. I get to continually learn new things. And I get to make things beautiful.</p>
                <p>I still love to bake, hike, garden, occasionally find time to paint, make awesome family themed halloween costumes, and try as often as possible to explore what the world has to offer.</p>
